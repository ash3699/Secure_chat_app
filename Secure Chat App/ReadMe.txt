This is a secure chat application implemented over C++, using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). 
The chat application supports both client and server modes.

Prerequisites
    OpenSSL library
    C++ compiler

Compilation

    Execute the following command to complile the code:

    g++ -o secure_chat_app secure_chat_app.cpp -lssl -lcrypto

Server Mode

    Use the following command to run the chat application in server mode:

    ./secure_chat_app -s

    This will start the server that will listen for incoming connections from clients.

Client Mode

    Provide the hostname of the server as an argument in the below command to run the chat application in client mode:

    ./secure_chat_app -c <server_hostname>

Protocol

    The chat is initiated by the clien by sending a "chat_hello" message to the server.
    The server replies with a "chat_ok_reply" message when it receives the "chat_hello" message.
    Once the handshake is complete, the client will the send a "chat_START_SSL" message to the server to start the DTLS handshake.
    Both client and server can exchange messages securely after the DTLS handshake is completed successfully.

Security

    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is used to secure communication between the client and server.
    Certificates and keys are used for authentication and encryption.
    Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) cipher suites are preferred for enhanced security.

Error Handling

    The code includes error handling mechanisms to handle various failure scenarios, such as socket creation failure, handshake failures, and DTLS-related errors.
